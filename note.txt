    - Linear Regression: 
        . Need to train on real data(get from DB) -> export the model
        . currently not suitable with the data schema
    - GraphX:
        . Currently have no value when no connection between vertices (e.g household IOT)
        . If want to use GraphX, we should define a use case where households receive electricity from transformers(T1,T2...)
          ->  create a complex network to identify overloaded or have complex connections. 
              Once identified, we can reduce the complexity by adding additional transformers to balance the load.
